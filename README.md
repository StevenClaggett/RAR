RFID Attendance Record

A simple java-based system for use with a mifair RFID reader attatched to an arduino UNO running a specific sketch (will) be added later.


Use in netbeans.
You need to have RXTX installed.
Add this to your Project Properties -> Run:
  -Djava.library.path="C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_31\bin;%PATH%"
  That path needs to point to your .dll's for RXTX.
